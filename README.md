# Hi!

The pinned public repositories below — especially **Guttis** and **BackupTool** — are not just hobby projects.

**Guttis** is a simple static website built with Bootstrap. It’s complete and live via GitHub Pages, using a Cloudflare proxy with basic SEO optimization.

I started working on **BackupTool**, a Java-based backup application. The project is currently around 60–70% finished regarding merge and full backup features.  
It includes multithreading, dynamic memory buffering, and several AES encryption methods.  
The GUI is built with FXML, and backups can be scheduled per minute, daily, or on a specific date.
