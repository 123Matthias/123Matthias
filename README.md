# Hi!

The pinned public repositories below in this README, especially **Guttis** and **BackupTool**, are not only fun projects.  
**Guttis** is a simple static website built with a little help from Bootstrap. It is finished and running on GitHub Pages with Cloudflare proxy and SEO optimization.

I’m working on finishing a backup tool in Java with multithreading and dynamic memory buffering, supporting different backup types.  
The basic GUI is created with FXML, and I’ve implemented several AES encryption methods.  
Timing can be set per minute, day, or specific date.
